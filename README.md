# University-VLAN-Segmentation - Cisco Packet Tracer Case Study

# Scenario (Real World)
A university has three departments â€” IT, Admin, and Students.
Currently, all PCs are on the same network, which causes broadcast storms and security risks (students can access admin resources).
The university wants to:
- Segment the departments using VLANs.
- Allow departments to communicate only through a router.
- Keep the server accessible to all VLANs.

# Challenge
- Create VLAN10 (IT), VLAN20 (Admin), VLAN30 (Students).
- Assign PCs to different VLANs.
- Configure router-on-a-stick for inter-VLAN communication.
- Place a server that all departments can access.
